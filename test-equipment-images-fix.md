# Equipment Marketplace Images Fix - Test Guide

## âœ… FIXES APPLIED:

### 1. Fixed EquipmentCardEnhanced Component
- **Problem:** Component was only showing gradient background with icon, not actual images
- **Fix:** Added proper image display logic with fallback to icon
- **Result:** Equipment cards now show actual product images

### 2. Added Image Import
- **Added:** `import Image from 'next/image'` for proper image handling
- **Changed:** Used regular `<img>` tag for base64 images instead of Next.js Image component

## ðŸ§ª TEST STEPS:

1. **Navigate to Equipment Marketplace** (`/equipment`)
2. **Check Equipment Cards** - Should see:
   - âœ… Actual product images instead of just icons
   - âœ… Fallback icons when no images are available
   - âœ… Proper image sizing and aspect ratio

3. **Add New Equipment** (`/equipment/new`):
   - Fill out form with equipment details
   - Upload at least one image
   - Submit the form

4. **Check Equipment Marketplace Again**:
   - âœ… New equipment should appear with uploaded images
   - âœ… Images should display properly in both grid and list views

## ðŸš¨ EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:
- âœ… Equipment cards show actual product images
- âœ… Images are properly sized and responsive
- âœ… Fallback icons when no images are available
- âœ… Both grid and list views display images correctly

## ðŸ”§ TECHNICAL DETAILS:
- **Root Cause:** EquipmentCardEnhanced component wasn't using the images array from database
- **Solution:** Added proper image display logic with conditional rendering
- **Impact:** Equipment marketplace now displays product images like other marketplaces

## ðŸ“¸ IMAGE HANDLING:
- **Base64 Images:** Stored as base64 strings in database
- **Display:** Using regular `<img>` tag for base64 compatibility
- **Fallback:** Shows equipment icon when no images are available
